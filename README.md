#  Client Behavior Prediction Using AI in Banking

This project aims to predict how banking clients are likely to respond to direct marketing efforts. Using a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms, ensemble models, and neural networks, it analyzes client data to forecast whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
